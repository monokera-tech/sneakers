## Changes Between 2.8.0 and 2.10.0

This release contains **minor breaking API changes**.

### Worker Timeouts are No Longer Enforced

This is a **breaking change** for `Sneakers::Worker` implementations.

Timeouts can be disruptive and dangerous depending on what the workers do but not having them can also
lead to operational headaches.

The outcome of [a lengthy discussion](https://github.com/jondot/sneakers/issues/343) on possible
alternatives to the timeout mechanisms is that only applications
can know where it is safe to enforce a timeout (and how).

`Sneakers::Worker` implementations are now expected to enforce timeouts
in a way that makes sense (and is safe) to them.

## Changes Between 2.6.0 and 2.7.0

This release requires Ruby 2.2 and has **breaking API changes**
around custom error handlers.
